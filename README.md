About the Project
-------------
Project Astraeus is a top down 3D shooter. This game resembles some of the retro games from my past that I loved like Astroids and Galaga. In this game the player assumes the roll of a space fighter and must protect the Astraeus, a large capital ship. In the demo the player will be projecting the Astraeus from asteroids as they attempt to collect valuble ore. To complete their mission, the player must collect the required ore and keep the Astraeus intact while it prepares to jump from the system. The player's ship is armed with lasers and rockets to help them complete their mission.

About the Creator
-------------
My name is Darren Kent and I am graduate from Dixie State University with a Bachelors in Computer
Science. Throughout my life games have been my passion. From board games to card games and
ever since I got my first NES when I was a kid, video games. Over time I have developed many
skills that will help me in the future with making games. For a long time I worked as a graphic
artist and I decided to pursue a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I figured
with the skills I have, why not try my hand at making games and I have been loving it ever since.
